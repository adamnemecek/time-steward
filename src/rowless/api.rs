(Although, for instance, modifications made for dependency tracking purposes might not change any results any queries, so they wouldn't create the need for any invalidation.)

// Event must implement undo. After an event is undone, there may not remain any modifications at the time of that event. It follows that after doing and then undoing an event, all query results immediately before the event are equal to the corresponding results immediately after the event.
